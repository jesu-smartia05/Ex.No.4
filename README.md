### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
# Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.


Main Objectives:

‚Ä¢	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
‚Ä¢	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
‚Ä¢	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
‚Ä¢	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚ÄúWhat features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?‚Äù Generated Ideas:
‚Ä¢	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
‚Ä¢	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.
‚Ä¢	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.
‚Ä¢	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

Persona and Context Prompts:

‚Ä¢	Prompt: ‚ÄúWhat should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?‚Äù Generated Context:
‚Ä¢	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
‚Ä¢	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.

Case Study 2: Designing an AI-Powered Customer Service Chatbot
Objective

To design an AI-powered chatbot that can efficiently assist customers with:

Product troubleshooting

Order tracking

General inquiries

The chatbot must provide accurate responses while maintaining a conversational, friendly, and user-centered tone.

1. Comparative Analysis Prompting

Here we test different prompting styles and compare outcomes.

a. Task-Oriented Prompt

Prompt Example:
‚ÄúYou are a customer service assistant. Help customers troubleshoot issues, track orders, and answer general questions in a polite and concise manner.‚Äù

Strengths: Direct, efficient, covers core tasks.

Weaknesses: May sound robotic, lacks personality.

b. Persona-Driven Prompt

Prompt Example:
‚ÄúYou are a friendly and empathetic customer service agent named ‚ÄòNova.‚Äô Greet customers warmly, address concerns with empathy, and provide step-by-step help for troubleshooting, order tracking, and inquiries.‚Äù

Strengths: Human-like, engaging, builds trust.

Weaknesses: Risk of verbosity, may stray from task focus.

c. Comparative Analysis Outcome

Task-Oriented Prompt ‚Üí Works best for quick issue resolution.

Persona-Driven Prompt ‚Üí Better for customer satisfaction and engagement.
‚û°Ô∏è Hybrid approach is ideal (combine clarity + friendliness).

2. Universal Prompt Pattern

This approach creates one powerful universal prompt that adapts to multiple contexts.

Prompt Example:
"You are an AI-powered chatbot that helps customers by: (1) troubleshooting product issues with clear step-by-step instructions, (2) tracking orders using order ID or customer details, and (3) answering general inquiries in a simple and polite tone. Always respond in a friendly, empathetic way while staying concise and accurate."

Advantages: Covers multiple use cases in a single prompt.

Disadvantages: Can become too broad; risk of generic responses.

3. Structured Prompt Refinements

Here, we refine prompts with structured formatting.

Structured Prompt Example:

*"When answering, follow this format:

Greet the customer warmly.

Identify the type of request (Troubleshooting / Order Tracking / General Inquiry).

Provide a clear, step-by-step solution or answer.

Ask if they need further help."*

Advantages: Consistency, predictable flow, reduces confusion.

Disadvantages: May feel repetitive, less natural in long conversations.

4. Prompt Size Limitations

Short Prompt (Minimal):
‚ÄúYou are a chatbot for troubleshooting, order tracking, and FAQs. Be polite.‚Äù
‚Üí Fast, efficient, but too vague.

Long Prompt (Detailed Persona + Instructions):
Multiple role definitions, tone instructions, fallback strategies, escalation rules.
‚Üí Rich, but can cause latency or token overuse.

Finding Balance

Medium-length prompts perform best:

Enough detail to guide behavior

Not too long to cause inefficiency

Conclusion & Recommendations

Comparative Analysis: Persona-driven + task-oriented hybrid is optimal.

Universal Prompt: Useful for initial deployment, but may lack depth.

Structured Prompt Refinements: Ensures clarity and consistency.

Prompt Size Limitations: Keep prompts medium-sized for balance.

üëâ Final Takeaway:
For a customer service chatbot, use a hybrid persona-task prompt with structured refinements, keeping instructions concise but specific.

# Result: 
Thus, the various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
